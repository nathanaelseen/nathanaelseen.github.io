In this section, I will discuss the given proposition, the intuition behind the proof, and the
proof itself.

**Proposition**

In the set $$\mathbb{N}$$, there is no largest integer.

**Proof**

Assume the contrary, that there is indeed a largest integer, $$M \in \mathbb{N}$$.

But, consider $$(M + 1) > M$$.

We note that $$M$$ is also an integer, and that, $$M \in \mathbb{N}$$.

But, this contradicts the maximality of $$M$$. $$\blacksquare$$
