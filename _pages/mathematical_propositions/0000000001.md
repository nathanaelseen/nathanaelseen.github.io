In this section, I will discuss the given proposition, the intuition behind the proof, and the
proof itself.

_**Proposition**_

The set of prime numbers is infinite.

[//]: # _**Intuition**_

_**Proof**_

Assume the contrary, that the set of primes are finite instead.

Then, we can list the primes in such fashion; $$S = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_k\}$$, for some
$$k \in \mathbb{N}$$, where $$k$$ is finite.

Let, $$N = (p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot ... \cdot p_k) + 1$$.

Then, since $$N > 1$$ obviously, there exists a prime $$q \in \mathbb{R} \ni q \mid N$$.

In fact, $$q \in S$$, since the set of primes is finite, by our hypothesis.

Hence, $$q \mid (p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot ... \cdot p_k)$$.

But, $$q \nmid (p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot ... \cdot p_k) + 1 = N$$ $$ => q \nmid N$$.

But, this Contradicts our previous assertion that $$q \mid N$$. $$\blacksquare$$
