_**Question**_

If the sequence $$(s_n)_{n=1}^\infty$$ is bounded, prove that for any $$\varepsilon > 0$$ there is a
closed interval $$J \subset \mathbb{R}$$ of length $$\varepsilon$$ such that $$s_n \in J$$ for
infinitely many values of $$n$$.

[//]: # _**Intuition**_

_**Proof**_

Let $$\varepsilon > 0$$, be given.

Since, the sequence $$(s_n)_{n=1}^\infty$$ is bounded,
$$\exists M \in \mathbb{R} \ni \left\lvert s_n \right\rvert \leqslant M$$
$$(\forall n \in \mathbb{N})$$ $$\Longrightarrow -M \leqslant s_n$$
$$\leqslant M$$ $$(\forall n \in \mathbb{N})$$.

Now, we note that within the closed interval $$[-M, M]$$, the number of terms in
$$(s_n)_{n=1}^\infty$$ is (countably) infinite.

Also, the closed interval has length $$2M > 0$$.

Now, we could divide this interval into $$2$$ parts, of length;
$$2M - \varepsilon$$ and $$\varepsilon$$ respectively, such that each part
has $$N_1$$ and $$N_2$$ terms, and the total number of terms is $$N = N_1 + N_2$$.

(Here, we note that $$\varepsilon < 2M$$.)

Since $$N$$ is countably infinite, we can infer that either both
$$N_1$$ and $$N_2$$ are countably infinite, or that one of them is.

In either case, one of them is (guaranteed) to be countably infinite, and
hence we obtain a set $$J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$$ of finite arbitrary length,
which contains infinite elements.

Now, for the case of any $$\varepsilon \geqslant 2M$$, we can always box
our closed interval $$[-M, M]$$, with that $$\varepsilon > 0$$.

Thus, for any $$\varepsilon \geqslant 2M$$, all infinite elements of the sequence
$$(s_n)_{n=1}^\infty$$ is present there. $$\blacksquare$$
