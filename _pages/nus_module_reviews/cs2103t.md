In this section, I'm writing my personal take on CS2103T, how I felt about it,
and probably some advice for the juniors who have yet to take this mod too!

I've also left the same [module review](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2103T/software-engineering)
on NUSMods.

_Taken in AY19/20 Sem 2_

_Lecturer: Mr. Akshay Narayan_

**Description:**

This module is on Software Engineering (SE), one of the more practical
branches in Computer Science, especially if you're going out for
internships.

Using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), imperative style, as the
backdrop, many SE principles were introduced to us, throughout the
semester.

Broadly, 4 aspects of SE were covered, and they are; requirements gathering,
software design, implementation, and quality assurance.

Firstly for requirements gathering, we covered some general aspects, like;
prioritising requirements and Non-Functional Requirements, before looking at
a few requirements gathering techniques. Apart from requirements gathering,
we also studied techniques for requirements specification, with particular
emphasis on User Stories.

For software design, we studied some general design principles, like;
Abstraction and Coupling, and the various Unified Modelling Language (UML)
tools used to model a software, including; Class, Activity, and Sequence Diagrams.
Additionally, we studied some common design/architectural patterns and solutions.

For implementation, it was quite rule-based, where various principles
which constitutes good code quality and best practices were advocated. Other
topics covered, includes; documentation, logging, debugging, error-handling,
and defensive programming.

Lastly, for quality assurance, we mainly focussed on software testing, including
things like how to design effective/efficient test cases and the various test
heuristics.

**Relationship to CS2030:**

This module requires quite a strong foundation of the OOP imperative style,
as we worked with that throughout the entire module.

As previously mentioned, this programming style was used to introduce
all the other SE principles in this module.

In fact, the first week was dedicated to just recapping all that was covered
in CS2030 about OOP programming (in Java).

This is because, some of the SE principles required these basic OOP knowledge.

One example would be the command design pattern, which required working
knowledge of what polymorphism is.

**Relationship to CS2040S:**

Although this module was included as a prerequsite, there doesn't seem
to be any overlap with CS2040S.

The SE principles introduced, didn't really involve any speicific knowledge
of data structures and algorithms.

Perhaps, during the SE project, some teams might see some overlap of CS2040S,
as they use knowledge in CS2040S to optimise certain segments of code for
time and space efficiency.

However, in this module, grading was not based on how optimal code runs, but
based on the adherance of all the SE principles and best practices covered.


**Some study tips (my two cents worth):**


All the best, and hope this helps!
