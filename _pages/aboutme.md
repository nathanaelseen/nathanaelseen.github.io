description: A brief introduction about myself

In this section, I will give a brief introduction about myself.

---

Hi, my name is Nathanael Seen, and I'm currently studying Computer Science (Mathematics Minor)
in [NUS](http://www.nus.edu.sg/).

Within Computer Science, my main interest lies in Theoretical Comp Sci, specifically,
Algorithms and Theory.

This is due to my interest for Mathematics as well.

As an aside, I'm also looking for Computer Science internship opportunities and jobs.
