description: A brief introduction about myself

In this section, I will give a brief introduction about myself.

---

Hi there, my name is Nathanael Seen, and I'm currently studying Computer
Science (Mathematics Minor) in [NUS](http://www.nus.edu.sg/).

Within Computer Science, my main interest lies in Theoretical Comp. Sci., specifically in
Algorithms and Theory. (This is due to my interest for Mathematics as well.)

_As an aside, I'm also looking for Computer Science internship opportunities and jobs._
