Hi, thank you for visiting my personal website.

My name is Nathanael Seen, and I'm currently studying Computer Science (Mathematics minor) at [NUS](http://www.nus.edu.sg/).

I've learnt quite a lot of stuffs over at the university, and I thought I would just share some of the most interesting
ones.

As such, in this space, I'll primarily write about [Computer Science](/compsci), [Mathematics](/math), and other
[Tech](/tech) stuffs.

I'm also looking for Software Engineering internships, and Computing related job opportunities.
