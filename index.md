Hi, thank you for visiting my personal website.

I'm Nathanael Seen, and I'm currently studying Computer Science (Mathematics minor) at [NUS](http://www.nus.edu.sg/).

I've learnt quite a lot of interesting stuffs over at the University, and I thought it would be good to share some of
them.

As such, in this website, I'll be primarily writing about **Computer Science**, **Mathematics**, and other
**Tech** stuffs.

_As an aside, I'm also looking for Software Engineering internships, and Computing related job opportunities!_
