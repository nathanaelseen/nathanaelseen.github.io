Hi, thank you for visiting my personal website.

I'm Nathanael Seen, and I'm currently studying Computer Science (Mathematics minor) at [NUS](http://www.nus.edu.sg/).

I've learnt quite a lot of interesting stuffs over at the University, and I thought it would be good to share some of
them.

Just treat this website, as your one-stop _Google_ for **Computer Science**, **Mathematics**, and other
**Tech** stuffs.

There is a wealth of information on this site, what you manage to find depends on how
and what you search! :P
